# Unit-4-Game

Relatively straightforward in terms of game logic, though more difficult in the use of jquery.
Utilizes an array to store the values of the jewels rather than variables - which seems to have taken longer than it needed to, but also might be easier for if I wanted to add in 50 jewels, since I just need to adjust the array length, and the for loop does the rest.
